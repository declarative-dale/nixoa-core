NiXOA is intentionally a single-appliance Den flake. `flake.nix` evaluates the
`modules/` import tree, and Den materializes one host entity:

```text
den.hosts.x86_64-linux.nixoa
└── nixosConfigurations.nixoa
```

The `nixoa` host aspect composes four focused aspects:

```text
nixoa
├── platform   NixOS base, networking, Nix policy, DBus safeguards
├── xcp-ng     Xen guest agent and constrained NoCloud provisioning
├── xo         Xen Orchestra service, TLS, and storage
└── operator   nixoa account, SSH, Home Manager, nxcli, and menu
```

The flake exports one concrete appliance configuration and one operator-side
template builder.

The native XCP-ng template builder runs on the operator workstation.
`packages.x86_64-linux.installer-iso` evaluates a small live installer, while
`nix run --accept-flake-config .#deploy-template` realizes Packer and its
XenServer plugin in the caller's Nix store. The installed system is
`nixosConfigurations.nixoa`.

The flake directly declares the Determinate, NiXOA, and Xen Orchestra binary
caches. Integrated libvhdi comes from the Xen Orchestra flake. The
multi-gigabyte installer is instead a GitHub Actions
artifact: the `deploy-template` app selects the newest successful `main` run,
downloads and verifies the ISO at deployment time, and passes its temporary
path to Packer. The source flake and runtime installer selection stay
independently pinned. An exact checkout-local ISO is available through
`INSTALLER_SOURCE=build`.

Repository delivery is Nix-defined and flake-packaged. Hosted workflow command
bodies call declared devenv tasks through a thin flake app, and those tasks
delegate implementation to `packages.x86_64-linux.nixoa-ci`. Workflows retain
GitHub security boundaries—permissions, OIDC, artifacts, attestations, Cachix,
and FlakeHub. The prepare program combines source classification and immutable
artifact reuse into one versioned JSON plan consumed by later jobs and the
stable gate. A Nix policy declares which source paths affect the immutable
installer fingerprint, allowing metadata-only commits to reuse a previously
verified artifact while unknown paths fail safely toward rebuilding. The same
policy filters both changed paths and the tracked-file fingerprint, preventing
classification and reuse from disagreeing. Only
path-classifying events fetch full Git history, and future merge-group
classification also fails toward rebuilding unless its base is a known
ancestor of its head. Hosted leaf tasks run in isolated Devenv mode, while
rolling and versioned publication share one non-canceling concurrency queue.
The plan producer and stable gate validate the same strict JSON Schema, so
field, type, digest, and lifecycle invariants cannot drift between them.

## Module layout

```text
modules/
├── dendritic.nix
├── den-defaults.nix
├── host.nix
├── aspects/
│   ├── platform.nix
│   ├── xcp-ng.nix
│   ├── xo.nix
│   └── operator.nix
├── _nixos/
│   ├── platform.nix
│   ├── xcp-ng.nix
│   ├── operator.nix
│   └── xo/
│       ├── default.nix
│       ├── service.nix
│       ├── tls.nix
│       └── storage.nix
└── _homeManager/
```

The underscore directories contain class modules composed through the aspect
tree.

## Host ownership

`host/default.nix` imports three policy layers:

- `settings.nix`: operator-maintained settings
- `hardware-configuration.nix`: generated during bootstrap and the sole source
  of filesystems, swap, disks, and hardware discovery
- `menu.nix`: generated console overrides

Menu-managed operator values are defaults in `settings.nix`, so explicit values
in `menu.nix` take precedence without allowing the TUI to rewrite durable
policy.

## Clone provisioning

The XCP-ng aspect enables cloud-init for Xen Orchestra NoCloud config drives.
Its scope is deliberately narrow: select `NoCloud` with a `None` fallback,
target the existing `nixoa` operator, install datasource SSH keys, and create
per-instance SSH identity. Declarative NixOS configuration remains authoritative
for accounts, sudo, network configuration, filesystem declarations, packages,
and services. Cloud-init installs NoCloud SSH keys and can grow the existing
root partition and filesystem. systemd-networkd applies a DHCP-provided
transient hostname through the narrowly authorized hostnamed action.

SSH starts after `cloud-config.service`, ensuring NoCloud keys are processed
before the operator connects.

## XO runtime

`modules/_nixos/xo/service.nix` owns the `xo` account, Valkey instance,
generated TOML, filesystem layout, and hardened `xo-server` unit.

`tls.nix` creates a long-lived self-signed certificate when configured files
are absent or expired.

`storage.nix` provides NFS/CIFS/VHD support. XO remains unprivileged; mount and
libvhdi operations cross privilege boundaries through a validated root helper
and a narrow sudo rule. CIFS credentials travel over standard input and use a
short-lived, root-readable credential file.

## Operational invariants

- target and host entity: `nixoa`
- architecture: `x86_64-linux`
- hypervisor: XCP-ng/Xen
- operator: `nixoa`
- initial state version: `26.05`
- direct XO package:
  `inputs.xen-orchestra-ce.packages.x86_64-linux.latest`

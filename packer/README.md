# Packer deployment

The repository can build and deploy Maestro without installing Packer into a
profile or into the appliance:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/closure-labs/maestro.git
cd maestro
nix run --accept-flake-config .#deploy-template -- \
  --host XCP_POOL_MASTER \
  --iso-sr "ISO library" \
  --sr "Local storage" \
  --network "VM network" \
  --export-network "VM network" \
  --template-name Maestro \
  --memory-mb 4096 \
  --disk-size-mb 20480 \
  --operator-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Nix supplies Packer from pinned nixpkgs and builds the Vates XenServer plugin
at pinned version 0.11.4. Both live only in the caller's Nix store. Neither is
added to `nixosConfigurations.maestro`.

The helper saves non-secret pool settings to the ignored
`packer/local.pkrvars.json`. It never writes the XCP-ng password. Set
`PKR_VAR_remote_password` for non-interactive use; otherwise the helper prompts
without echo.

The lower-level builder is also a first-class app. It consumes an existing
Packer variable file without running the interactive configuration step:

```bash
nix run --accept-flake-config .#build-template -- \
  -var-file=packer/local.pkrvars.json
```

Both apps use the same Nix-packaged Packer and XenServer plugin. Run them from
the checkout whose `packer/` sources and appliance flake should be built, or
set `MAESTRO_SYSTEM_ROOT` explicitly.

GitHub Actions builds the deployer, appliance packages, complete system, and
installer ISO. The complete, closure-preseeded ISO is retained for 90 days as
the `maestro-installer` workflow artifact; only the smaller reusable Maestro
packages are pushed to Cachix. `nix run --accept-flake-config
.#deploy-template` downloads the artifact from the newest successful `main`
workflow run into a temporary directory, verifies its SHA-256 checksum, and
passes it directly to Packer. Run `gh auth login` once before using the
deployer.

The Cachix and Determinate substituters are declared directly in `flake.nix`.
The GitHub artifact is deliberately resolved by the flake app's runtime helper,
not declared as a flake input or pinned in `flake.lock`. It may briefly lag the
checkout while a newer `main` workflow is still running. Set
`INSTALLER_SOURCE=build` for an exact build of the current checkout, or
`INSTALLER_ISO=/path/to/image.iso` to deploy a specific image.

## What the build does

1. The deployer downloads the headless, UEFI-only installer built from
   `packages.x86_64-linux.installer-iso` by GitHub Actions and gives its
   checksum-verified path directly to Packer. Set `INSTALLER_SOURCE=build` to
   build it locally or `INSTALLER_ISO=/path/to/image.iso` to use an existing
   image. The ISO remains limited to the
   Xen unattended-install path and uses networkd for DHCP, but its Nix store is
   preseeded with the complete generic Maestro system closure, `maestro-menu`, and
   Xen Orchestra so first installation needs only source metadata and small
   machine-specific derivations from the network.
2. Packer uploads that ISO to the selected ISO SR and creates one UEFI VM with
   one disk and a DHCP network.
3. The live installer requires explicit destructive confirmation, partitions
   only that single Packer disk, clones `maestro`, writes the operator key, and
   generates the hardware module.
4. `nixos-install` installs `.#maestro`; the VM reboots twice while Packer verifies
   cloud-init, Xen guest integration, Redis, XO, TLS, and SSH. Packer gives XO a
   fixed four-minute startup grace period only on the installed system's first
   boot; the second verification retries its endpoint immediately.
5. The final provisioner restores key-only SSH, commits generated host policy,
   removes obsolete Nix generations and store paths with `nh clean all`, clears
   cloud-init and machine identity, removes SSH host keys, and lets the
   XenServer plugin mark the VM as a native template.

The installer is the only component that creates or formats partitions. The
installed appliance continues to use `host/hardware-configuration.nix` as its
sole disk and filesystem declaration source; on a clone, cloud-init may extend
only the existing root partition and filesystem to consume a larger virtual
disk.

## Clone validation

Create a VM from the template, attach a Xen Orchestra NoCloud config drive with
an SSH key for `maestro`, and boot it. Then run:

```bash
sudo /home/maestro/maestro/packer/scripts/verify-clone.sh
```

The check requires a NoCloud datasource, new machine and SSH identities,
key-only SSH, healthy Redis/XO services, and a responding HTTPS endpoint.

The known `maestro`/`maestro` password exists only in the live installer and the
temporary Packer override. The sealing step locks it before the native template
is finalized.
